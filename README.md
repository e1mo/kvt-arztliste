# KVT-Arztliste Scraper

## About & Motivation

The "Kassen채rztliche Vereinigung Th체ringen" (Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Thuringia) provides a central form to search for doctors in Thuringia.
You can filter by profession, additional services and so on. Which is **great**.
But the interface has certain limitations. For example, you can not serach for multiple professions, focuses or range of services.
Which frankly isn't great if you, well, need to filter for multiple of these.
Further more, there is no way to get the doctors in a machine readable form.
If that would be the case, it would be easy to generate an spreadsheet of doctors you need to call and when you can call them (especial with Psychotherapists thats not a trivial task).

Bothered by this ourself, we decided to make to make the huge pile of data they are sitting on and making it a bit more open.
Mainly to ease access to care.

This project aims to extract doctors from the serach interface provided by the "Kassen채rztliche Vereinigung Th체ringen" and provide them in a machine readable format to help those in need to find the doctors they need.

## What's next

### WebGUI

We are planning to create a WebGUI to offer the features we feel that are missing.
These range from filtering for multiple options in one category to exporting the results of your query as a spreadsheet or something else.

### Your project

There are numerous cool projects. For example, you could create an application that generates lists with times when you can call doctors.
This is just one example, we are sure there are many project ideas that can help everyone!
